# Mastering ROS 2 Intermediate and Advanced Concepts 🚀

This repository contains my progress and projects as I follow the Udemy course **"Master ROS 2 Intermediate and Advanced Concepts"** by Edouard Renard. The course is designed to help developers deepen their understanding of ROS 2 and create better robotics applications by mastering core concepts.

## 🗂️ Course Outline and Topics Covered

The course is divided into four main sections:
1. **Actions**  
   - Generate and build an Action Definition.  
   - Write a complete Action server and client.  
   - Implement goal policies.

2. **Lifecycle Nodes**  
   - Create initialization sequences for nodes.  
   - Explore different states of a node lifecycle.

3. **Executors**  
   - Understand how the spin works.  
   - Use single-threaded and multi-threaded executors.

4. **Components**  
   - Add several nodes in one executable (composition).  
   - Create ROS 2 components for runtime loading.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of ROS 2 (recommended: completion of "ROS 2 for Beginners" course).  
- Ubuntu installed on your system (preferably as dual-boot).  
- A working ROS 2 Humble environment.

## 🌟 Objectives

- Master intermediate and advanced ROS 2 concepts.  
- Build and run projects demonstrating Actions, Lifecycle Nodes, Executors, and Components.  
- Understand best practices and apply them in real-world robotics applications.

## 📝 Key Learnings and Challenges

Each section includes challenges and projects to solidify the concepts. I’ll document key takeaways and solutions as I progress through the course.
